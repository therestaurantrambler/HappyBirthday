Happy Birthday App
===================================

This is a single page app wishing Ben a happy birthday from Lyla.
It is from a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree called Happy Birthday App. 
I made this app to become familiar with Installation of Android Studio and Java and  creation of a single page app using XML.


Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
